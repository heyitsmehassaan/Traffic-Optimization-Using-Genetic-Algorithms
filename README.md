# Traffic Optimization Using Genetic Algorithms: 


---

## **Overview**

Traffic congestion is a significant issue in modern urban areas, resulting in delays, pollution, and increased costs. This project demonstrates the application of genetic algorithms to optimize traffic light timings and reduce overall waiting times at intersections. The SimpleTrafficOptimizer class simulates and manages traffic flow across multiple intersections, leveraging evolutionary techniques for optimization.

---
## **Features**

Dynamic Traffic Simulation: Simulates vehicle flow at intersections with customizable parameters.
Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Implements mutation, crossover, and selection techniques to minimize total waiting time.
Traffic Light Management: Provides a robust framework for simulating light states and vehicle queues.
Highly Configurable: Supports adjustable parameters for intersections, traffic volume, and genetic algorithm settings.
